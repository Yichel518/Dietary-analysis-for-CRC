# Dietary-analysis-for-CRC
**Background:** Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world, and its morbidity and mortality are increasing year by year, so the study of cancer prevention and treatment is of great significance. 

**Methods:** Diet is associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). We combined two mouse models ApcMin/+ and AOM/DSS of colorectal cancer, to calculate and characterize survival and cancer phenotypes in mice affected by two diets. Using metagenomic, metabolomic and transcriptomic detection, to explore the role of different diets,  especially the black rice diet, in regulating the progression of colorectal cancer by regulating gut microbes and metabolites.
